# BASIC Code Transpiler
This web application transpiles from the BASIC programming language into executable JavaScript. The programming language is derived from [MiSoft BASIC](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/basic/id362411238) which, being my first programming language, I will always have a soft spot for. The application stores all code/files into LocalStorage, pressing "Run" will also backup the current code into LocalStorage.
